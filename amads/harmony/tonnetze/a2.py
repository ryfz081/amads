class A2VertexTonnetz:
    """
    This class encodes the so-called "neo-Riemannian" transforms between
    triads made of triangles between neighboring verices on the "Euler" (A2 triangulation) Tonnetz,
    where each vertex represents a pitch-class.

    Parameters
    ----------
    chord : Union[List[int], Chord, PitchCollection]
        The chord to analyze. Can be represented as:
        - A list of MIDI pitches representing a chord,
        - A Chord object,
        - A PitchCollection object.

    Attributes
    ----------
    pitch_multi_set : tuple
        The chord's pitches as MIDI numbers.
        This can include octave-specific entries (60) and duplicate entries (60, 60).
    pc_set : set
        The chord's pitch class set.
    root : int
        The pitch class of the derived chord root as estimated by Parncutt's algorithm.
    major_not_minor : bool
        Major chord if True, minor if False, error otherwise.
    l_transform : set
        The L-transform mapping of the original set `pitch_multi_set`, including duplicates.
    p_transform : set
        The P-transform (see notes at `l_transform`).
    r_transform : set
        The R-transform (see notes at `l_transform`).


    Examples
    --------
    >>> d_major = [2, 62, 6, 9]
    >>> euler = A2VertexTonnetz(d_major)
    >>> euler.root
    2

    >>> euler.leading_tone_exchange()
    >>> euler.l_transform
    (1, 61, 6, 9)

    >>> euler.parallel()
    >>> euler.p_transform
    (2, 62, 5, 9)

    >>> euler.relative()
    >>> euler.r_transform
    (2, 62, 6, 11)

    >>> roundtrip = A2VertexTonnetz(list(euler.r_transform))
    >>> roundtrip.relative()
    >>> roundtrip.r_transform == tuple(d_major)
    True

        Transforms move constituent pitches of the multiset in place, preserving octave.

        These numbers are taken to be pitch classes rather than true key numbers.

        you still end up with right pitch class, but at an even lower octave than intended.
